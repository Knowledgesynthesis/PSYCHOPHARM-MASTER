    question: 'A 45-year-old woman with major depressive disorder is started on an SSRI. After 2 days, she develops agitation, confusion, hyperreflexia, and clonus. She recently started tramadol for back pain. What is the most likely diagnosis?',
    options: [
      'Neuroleptic malignant syndrome',
      'Serotonin syndrome',
      'Anticholinergic toxicity',
      'Lithium toxicity',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Serotonin syndrome presents with the triad of mental status changes, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities (hyperreflexia, clonus). The combination of SSRI and tramadol (which has serotonergic properties) increases risk. Management includes discontinuing serotonergic agents and supportive care.',

    id: 'q2',
    type: 'mcq',
    category: 'Mood Stabilizers',
    question: 'A patient on lithium presents with coarse tremor, ataxia, confusion, and vomiting. Serum lithium level is 2.1 mEq/L. What is the most appropriate next step?',
    options: [
      'Continue lithium and add propranolol for tremor',
      'Hold lithium and provide supportive care with hydration',
      'Reduce lithium dose by 50%',
      'Switch to valproate',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'This patient has lithium toxicity (level >1.5 mEq/L, symptoms of coarse tremor, ataxia, confusion). Lithium should be held immediately. Treatment includes hydration, electrolyte management, and potentially hemodialysis for severe toxicity. Coarse tremor distinguishes toxicity from therapeutic fine tremor.',

    id: 'q3',
    type: 'mcq',
    category: 'Antipsychotics',
    question: 'A 28-year-old man started on haloperidol for acute psychosis develops sudden-onset neck twisting and upward eye deviation. What is the most appropriate immediate treatment?',
    options: [
      'Discontinue haloperidol and observe',
      'Diphenhydramine 50 mg IM',
      'Propranolol 20 mg PO',
      'Lorazepam 2 mg IM',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'This is acute dystonia (oculogyric crisis and torticollis), an extrapyramidal side effect of antipsychotics, especially first-generation agents. It responds rapidly to anticholinergics such as diphenhydramine or benztropine. This is a medical urgency requiring immediate treatment.',

  {
    id: 'q4',
    type: 'mcq',
    category: 'Switching',
    question: 'A patient needs to switch from fluoxetine to phenelzine (MAOI). What is the minimum washout period required?',
    options: [
      '3 days',
      '14 days (2 weeks)',
      '35 days (5 weeks)',
      '7 days (1 week)',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Fluoxetine has a very long half-life (4-6 days) and an active metabolite (norfluoxetine, 4-16 days). A 5-week washout is required before starting an MAOI to avoid potentially fatal serotonin syndrome. Most other SSRIs require only a 2-week washout.',

  {
    id: 'q5',
    type: 'mcq',
    category: 'Antipsychotics',
    question: 'Which second-generation antipsychotic has the highest risk of weight gain and metabolic syndrome?',
    options: [
      'Aripiprazole',
      'Ziprasidone',
      'Olanzapine',
      'Lurasidone',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Olanzapine has the highest risk of weight gain and metabolic effects among SGAs. Patients require monitoring of weight, fasting glucose, HbA1c, and lipid panel. Aripiprazole and ziprasidone have lower metabolic risk.',
  },
  {
    id: 'q6',
    type: 'mcq',
    category: 'Mood Stabilizers',
    question: 'A patient on lamotrigine develops a rash 3 weeks after starting the medication. What is the most appropriate action?',
    options: [
      'Continue lamotrigine and treat rash with antihistamines',
      'Reduce lamotrigine dose',
      'Discontinue lamotrigine immediately',
      'Add a corticosteroid cream',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Lamotrigine carries a black box warning for serious rashes including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and TEN. Any rash developing during lamotrigine treatment should prompt immediate discontinuation. Slow titration reduces but does not eliminate risk. Do NOT rechallenge.',
  },
  {
    id: 'q7',
    type: 'mcq',
    category: 'ADHD',
    question: 'Which of the following ADHD medications does NOT have abuse potential or require DEA scheduling?',
    options: [
      'Methylphenidate',
      'Amphetamine/dextroamphetamine',
      'Atomoxetine',
      'Lisdexamfetamine',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and is NOT a controlled substance. It has no abuse potential, making it a good choice when stimulant misuse is a concern or in patients with comorbid substance use disorders. Onset of action is delayed (2-4 weeks) compared to stimulants.',
  },
  {
    id: 'q8',
    type: 'mcq',
    category: 'Antidepressants',
    question: 'A patient with depression and insomnia is prescribed mirtazapine. At which dose is mirtazapine MOST sedating?',
    options: [
      'Lower doses (7.5-15 mg)',
      'Medium doses (30 mg)',
      'Higher doses (45 mg)',
      'Sedation is equal at all doses',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Mirtazapine is paradoxically MORE sedating at lower doses due to strong H1 receptor antagonism. At higher doses, increased noradrenergic effects counteract sedation. This makes lower doses useful for sleep but higher doses better for depression with less sedation.',
  },
  {
    id: 'q9',
    type: 'case',
    category: 'Antipsychotics',
    question: 'A 35-year-old woman with schizophrenia on clozapine for 3 months develops fever and sore throat. WBC is 2,500 with ANC 800. What is the most appropriate action?',
    options: [
      'Continue clozapine and treat symptomatically',
      'Reduce clozapine dose',
      'Discontinue clozapine permanently and refer to hematology',
      'Hold clozapine temporarily and recheck labs in 1 week',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'ANC <1000 indicates severe neutropenia, a serious complication of clozapine. The drug must be discontinued permanently and the patient should never be rechallenged. Hematology consultation is required. This is why weekly (then biweekly, then monthly) ANC monitoring through the REMS program is mandatory.',

    id: 'q10',
    type: 'mcq',
    category: 'Substance Use',
    question: 'Before starting naltrexone for opioid use disorder, what is the minimum duration the patient must be opioid-free?',
    options: [
      '1-2 days',
      '3-5 days',
      '7-10 days (14 days for long-acting opioids)',
      '30 days',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Naltrexone is a full opioid antagonist. Starting it while patient has physiologic opioid dependence will precipitate severe withdrawal. Patient must be opioid-free for 7-10 days (14 days for long-acting opioids like methadone). Naloxone challenge test can confirm readiness. This is a major limitation compared to buprenorphine, which can be started sooner.',
  },
  {
    id: 'q11',
    type: 'mcq',
    category: 'Antidepressants',
    question: 'Which antidepressant is LEAST likely to cause sexual side effects?',
    options: [
      'Sertraline',
      'Paroxetine',
      'Bupropion',
      'Venlafaxine',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Bupropion (NDRI) does not affect serotonin and has minimal to no sexual side effects. It is often combined with SSRIs/SNRIs to counteract their sexual side effects. SSRIs and SNRIs commonly cause sexual dysfunction (decreased libido, anorgasmia) due to serotonergic effects.',
  },
  {
    id: 'q12',
    type: 'mcq',
    category: 'Anxiety',
    question: 'A patient with generalized anxiety disorder asks about buspirone. Which statement about buspirone is correct?',
    options: [
      'It provides immediate anxiety relief',
      'It has high abuse potential',
      'It takes 2-4 weeks for full effect',
      'It is effective for panic disorder',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Buspirone is a 5-HT1A partial agonist with delayed onset (2-4 weeks), similar to SSRIs. It has no abuse potential, no dependence, and no withdrawal. However, it is NOT effective for panic disorder and does not provide immediate relief, limiting its use for acute anxiety.',
  },
  {
    id: 'q13',
    type: 'case',
    category: 'Mixed',
    question: 'A 50-year-old man with bipolar disorder on lithium and olanzapine presents with fever, rigidity, elevated CK, and confusion. Lithium level is 0.8 mEq/L (therapeutic). What is the most likely diagnosis?',
    options: [
      'Lithium toxicity',
      'Neuroleptic malignant syndrome',
      'Serotonin syndrome',
      'Catatonia',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is characterized by fever, lead-pipe rigidity, altered mental status, and elevated CK. It is caused by dopamine blockade from antipsychotics (olanzapine in this case). Lithium level is therapeutic, ruling out toxicity. Treatment: stop antipsychotic, supportive care, consider dantrolene/bromocriptine.',
  },
  {
    id: 'q14',
    type: 'mcq',
    category: 'Monitoring',
    question: 'Which laboratory test is NOT routinely required for clozapine monitoring?',
    options: [
      'Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)',
      'Fasting glucose and lipids',
      'Liver function tests',
      'Thyroid function tests',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Clozapine requires mandatory ANC monitoring (weekly, then biweekly, then monthly) due to agranulocytosis risk. Metabolic monitoring (glucose, lipids, weight) is also recommended due to high metabolic risk. LFTs may be done at baseline. Thyroid monitoring is NOT a specific requirement for clozapine (though it is for lithium).',
  },
  {
    id: 'q15',
    type: 'mcq',
    category: 'Special Populations',
    question: 'Which mood stabilizer is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy due to highest teratogenicity risk?',
    options: [
      'Lithium',
      'Valproate',
      'Lamotrigine',
      'Carbamazepine',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Valproate has the highest teratogenicity risk: neural tube defects, decreased IQ in offspring, and multiple congenital anomalies. It should be avoided in women of childbearing potential if possible. Lithium has risk of Ebstein anomaly but lower overall risk. Lamotrigine is relatively safer.',
