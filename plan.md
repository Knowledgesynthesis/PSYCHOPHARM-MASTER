## 6. Psychopharmacology Reasoning Framework

Teach universal prescribing logic:

1. Identify indication (mood, anxiety, psychosis, ADHD)  
2. Choose class → drug based on safety profile  
3. Screen for contraindications (e.g., bipolar before SSRI)  
4. Assess medical comorbidities & interactions  
5. Start appropriate dose & titrate  
6. Monitor labs if needed  
7. Manage side effects proactively  
8. Know when to switch vs augment  
9. Use emergency frameworks for adverse reactions  

Common pitfalls:
- Giving SSRI in unrecognized bipolar disorder  
- Missing lamotrigine rash danger  
- Confusing NMS with serotonin syndrome  
- Incorrect cross-taper leading to withdrawal  
- Missing clozapine CBC monitoring requirements
